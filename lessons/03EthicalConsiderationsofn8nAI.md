**Quizzes:**

**What does AI ethics primarily focus on?**

- Technical efficiency
- Profit maximization
- Moral guidelines and principles

**Answer:** Moral guidelines and principles

### Privacy and Data Protection

Privacy and data protection are critical concerns in the realm of AI. Systems like n8n AI often work with vast amounts of personal data, which need to be handled with care to protect individuals' rights to privacy. Strategies such as anonymization, encryption, and data minimization are pivotal in safeguarding sensitive information.

- Using diverse training data
- Increasing processing power
- Implementing faster algorithms

**Answer:** Using diverse training data

### Accountability and Transparency

Accountability in AI implies holding the parties involved in AI systems responsible for the outcomes and decisions made by these systems. Transparency involves making AI decision-making processes understandable to users and stakeholders, often described as the 'black box' problem. Advocating for explainable AI can enhance transparency and trust.
